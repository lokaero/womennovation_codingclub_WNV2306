3.	Conservation of resources: we should conserve resources such as water, and electricity by turning off lights and fans when not in use and properly closing taps.

5.	Recycling: recycling refers to using waste products in a useful way after some processes. Mostly plastics, paper, and glasses are recycled and they should be collected in a separate bin and given out for recycling in that way the waste in the environment can be reduced.
